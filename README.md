#salarymanagerandnotify

just a simple python script to calculate monthly expenses

##features
- three tiers of expenses. a couple of them have a tag related to part of the month. (for example: you should to pay rent in the first part of the month)
- two kind of reports. first - on salary day, second - on each monday.
- reports can be send to the email via smtp
- salary calculation from cryptocoins to classic money with the current AVG rate for this coin. you can get rate from exange portal 

###be careful
I am using a strange exange portal. It does not have an api. NORMAL API. It updates the zip archive every 30 seconds. You should download it. You should unpack it. You should process a coupole of CSV files - insane.
